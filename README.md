## BOOK APP

I am going to use [Google Books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using?hl=tr)

Must Have;

- The app needs to have 'find book' button to search books
- The app must have multi-pages like homepage - favouritepage, my books page ...
- The app must use custom hooks or Context API
- The app must have responsive design.

Could Have;

- The each book has image title when clicked details about the book
- The app could have the popular books of the week on the home page.
- The app could have favourite icon for each book.
- The app could have my cart page for shopping items.
